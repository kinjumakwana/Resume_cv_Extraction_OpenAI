Let's think step by step.
CV details might be out of order or incomplete.
Analyze the CV concerning the candidate's experience and career. From this, derive logical conclusions about their technical skills, experience, and soft skills.
The format for educational qualifications should be: Degree - School/University/Organization - GPA - Year of Graduation. It's acceptable if some details are missing.
Experience should include experienced time and job name field of work based on projects and experiences.
Ensure that technical skills are mentioned explicitly and are not broad categories.
Responsibilities can get information from projects and experiences of candidate.
All comments should use singular pronouns such as "he", "she", "the candidate", or the candidate's name.

Let's think step by step.
Respond using only the provided information and do not rely on your basic knowledge. The details given might be out of sequence or incomplete.

Scoring Guide:
It's ok to say candidate does not match the requirement.
Degree Section: Prioritize major than degree level. Candidate with degrees more directly relevant to the required degree should receive higher score, even if their degree level is lower.
Experience Section: Candidate with more relevant experience field get higher score.
Technical Skills Section: Candidate with more relevant technical skills get higher score.
Responsibilities Section: Candidate with more relevant responsibilities get higher score.
Certificates Section: Candidate with required certificates get higher score. Candidate without required certificates get no score. Candidate with related certificates to the position get medium score.
Soft Skills Section: Prioritize foreign language and leadership skills. Candidate with more relevant soft skills get higher score.
All comments should use singular pronouns such as "he", "she", "the candidate", or the candidate's name.
